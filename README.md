# basic_js_calc

this is a project I am using to re-familiarize myself with git and some javascript basics
and DOM elements I am in fact dusting off the cob webs :]

- core functionality complete
- we've achieved a working calculator

NEXT STEPS

- cache numbers and operations in a list, displayed tastefully
- cache numbers on screen after operator key is pressed
